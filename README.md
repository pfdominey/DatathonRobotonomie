# Robotonomie

clean patch of Robotonomie from the Datathon.

works with Python3.

make sure to "pip install" every import used in that are not featured in Python vanilla. 

To install face-recognition (and dlib), you will need to install CMake (https://cmake.org/download) and Visual Studio 2015 (or newer) with a C++ compiler (C++ Clang Compiler for Windows worked for me) then try using the script "pip-installs.py" to install all the packages needed.
