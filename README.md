works with Python3.

make sure to "pip install" every import used in that are not featured in Python vanilla. Try using the script "pip-installs.py" to install all the packages needed. You will need to install CMake (https://cmake.org/download). On Windows, you must have a Visual Studio desktop development with C++ (with the CMake tools for windows) install to build CMake.
