# Robotonomie

clean patch of Robotonomie from the Datathon.

works with Python3.

You will need to install several packages for python, the script "pip-installs.py" should do the work for you BUT :

- To install face-recognition (and dlib), you will need to install CMake (https://cmake.org/download) and Visual Studio 2015 (or newer) with a C++ compiler (C++ Clang Compiler for Windows worked for me).
