This is a photo of me and my family on vacation together in New York City, in august of 2014. I was with my family, with my wife Jocelyne, and our two daughters Emilie and Alexia. New York is like the Paris of the United States, and it was a great trip for us together there, feeling the great vibrations of this frantic city.
