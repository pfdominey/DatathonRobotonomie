This is a photo of the sacred Garan area on Mount Koyasan in Japan.
I took this photo in the Garan area on Mount Koyasan one year ago, in January 2019. I was by myself, but there was the spirit of Kobo-Daishi Kukai. Koyasan is a sacred mountain with a 20km pilgrimage trail, and temples where pilgrims can stay. I enjoy Koyasan and this picture reminds me of it.
