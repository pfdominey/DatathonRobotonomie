# Summary of the meeting (2022-03-30)

Were present : Louis Delamarre, Vincent Demey, Dorine Maillet, Bassam Kurdy, Magda Alsaleh, Mahmoud Ali, Melodie Opale
Were absent : Sami Ezzahid, Celine Petersson, Thomas Forest, Camille Huillet-Miraton, Imad Sfeir, Peter Dominey


## Goals : 
* Present the suggested chunks of work to be done during the datathon by subgroups of the team
* Allocate participants to subgroups, even if the goal is not to work in isolation but to promote collaboration and cross-polination


## Chunking the challenge into tasks

### 1. Data Collection  The initial proposition was to collect all the material (name of user, photos, texts...) in a folder or directory that we will access to analyze the data. 
  It requires a careful organisation to have similar file formats ... that may slow down the analysis as it can require secondary transformation of the raw data.
  Louis suggested using a collection system to collect the users' inputs into a dataframe that is already fit for analysis. For the challenge, we 
  can use Google Forms or any other form generator. 
  
  The suggested proprieties of the database are : 
    * user name 
    * user face photo : to allow for face recognition 
    * title : the title of the depicted situation
    * text : the text describing the user's memory/feelings/thoughts about the photo. 
      ** Peter proposed the following questions to help users in describing their pictures :
        1.	What is this photo?
        2.	Where did you take this photo?
        3.	When did you take this photo?
        4.	Who was with you when you took this photo?
        5.	Why do you like this photo?
    * photo : the photo to be uploaded
    
  Bassam asked if it would be useful to collect more than those elements (habits, where people lived, information about family...) to mimic what a caregiver
  might know about the elderly people of a nursing home, so that information can be used to reproduce the interaction a caregiver has with an elderly resident.
  I point that what is intended is not a strict replacement of human-human interaction, but an adjunct to facilitate social bonding between residents. 
  Maybe @Peter and @Imad can tell us more about what they think of this idea of @Bassam ? 
  
  
### 2. Text analysis :  The objective is to measure text similarity so we can build a similarity matrix that allows us to create a path of the discussion in the group session.
  Peter already provided elements and segments of code to help in preparing this analysis.
  
  
### 3. Image analysis :  This task was not planned initially, but can be interesting in achieving our goal, for the following purposes : 
  
    * face recognition : From a picture (or selfie) of the participant, the robot might be able to detect who is joining the group session and access their
    data to build the discussion from the experiences they shared.
      ** Bassam added that users' selfies may help in deriving age and sex from them and to better identify who they are or what their background is. That is 
      not the primary objective of the challenge, as it is supposed to use the situations the users choose to share to create a discussion and stimulate social 
      bond. 
      
    
    * image analysis from the photos the participants provided : 
      ** Mahmoud added that image similarity analysis and scenic analysis required considerably more time and resources than text analysis, depends on the 
      definition and the frame of the image... So not so straightforward. Bassam added that the similarity between the text and the image might be interesting.
      One way I see it is that finding similarity between text from one user and a photo of another that are not available in the text similarity analysis might
      be useful to create connections between users. 
      
      
    
    
### 4. Human-Robot interaction :   This task is about what and how we program the robot to interact with humans. Peter demonstrated an interaction last week. We first think about a robot 
  that speak and can speak to each user, show pictures and develop sentences specific to the photos and texts it has access to. 
    * Mahmoud asks about the programming language that will be used by the robot. This information is needed to discuss about what APIs are required, and to
    get from the inputs and the outputs of the program.
    
      ** @Peter, can you tell us more about that ? 
   
    
    
 ## Allocate participants to subgroups
 
 ### Data collection : no specific member for now
 ### Text analysis : Bassam, Magda, Melodie
 ### Image analysis : Mahmoud, Bassam
 ### Human-Robot Interaction : no specific member for now
  
 ## Misc. 
 Mahmoud : Who will be at Dijon for the datathon ? 
  Will be present : Vincent, Louis, Peter, Imad ?, Melodie.
  Will be online : Bassam, Magda.
  
Mahmoud asks if the Datathon Board has something organized for the accomodation ? 
  I don't know, but maybe @Peter, @Patrick Callier, @Dorine can tell us more.
